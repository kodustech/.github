# 🐶 Kodus — Reinventing How We Ship Code

> **AI changed how we write code. Now it’s time to change how we ship it.**

Welcome to Kodus!  

We’re building an ecosystem of **AI agents** to automate every step of software delivery — from review to release — helping dev teams ship production software **100x smarter**.

---

## 🚀 Why Kodus?

Generative AI made writing code 10x faster —  
but it also made **shipping it** 10x harder.

Today, developers face:
- More duplicate code with GenAI.
- Increased quality issues in AI-generated PRs.
- Slower, more manual review cycles.

We believe the **next AI wave** isn’t just about writing code faster.  
It’s about delivering that code **reliably** — without drowning in manual reviews or brittle processes.

## 🧠 What We’re Building

Kodus is:

✅ **Learning agents** that understand your whole codebase, not just the diff.  
✅ **Team-specific automation**, tuned to your patterns and rules.  
✅ **Open and extensible**, so the community can help shape the future.  
✅ **Secure and flexible**, running on cloud or on-prem.

Our first agent is **Kody**:

### An AI-powered PR reviewer  
that’s fast, consistent, and understands your team’s rules.

## 🌍 Why Open Source?

We believe:
- Trust comes from transparency.
- Community drives better tools.
- Open ecosystems win long-term.

Here on GitHub, you’ll find:
- 🧩 Core Kodus systems and integrations.  
- 🛡 Kody Rules — customizable rule libraries.  
- 🧠 Prompts and configs powering Kody’s brain.

We welcome contributions, feedback, and fresh ideas!
