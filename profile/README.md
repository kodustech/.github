# 🐶 Kodus

**Open source AI code review for teams shipping AI-generated code.**

Kodus helps teams review and ship code written with AI.  
As code generation gets faster, manual code review becomes the bottleneck.

## What is Kodus?

Kodus is an **open source AI code review platform**.

Its first agent is **Kody**, an AI-powered pull request reviewer that:
- Reviews PRs automatically
- Understands the codebase, not just the diff
- Follows your team’s rules
- Runs in the cloud or self-hosted

## Why Kodus?

AI-generated code increases:
- Review noise
- Duplicate logic
- Subtle bugs and security risks

Manual reviews do not scale with AI output. Kodus exists to fix that.

## How Kodus is different

Most AI code review tools focus on a single PR in isolation.

Kodus is built to understand **your system and your team over time**.

- **BYOK first**  
  Use your own LLM keys and providers instead of being locked into a hosted model.

- **Codebase-aware**  
  Learns repository structure and patterns instead of reviewing diffs only.

- **Rules over prompts**  
  Explicit, versioned rules make reviews predictable and low-noise.

- **Team-shaped behavior**  
  You control what matters, what blocks merges, and what gets ignored.

- **Open and self-hostable**  
  Fully open source, auditable, and deployable on your infrastructure.
